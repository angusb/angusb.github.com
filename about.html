      <p>This past spring I graduated from the University of Michigan  where I studied <a href="http://eecs.umich.edu/">Computer Science Engineering</a>. Upon graduation, I worked as a software engineering intern at <a href="http:/percolate.com">Percolate</a> in SoHo, New York for the summer. The past two summers before this I wrote code at Goldman Sachs. Come October, I will be hacking at <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a>.

      <p>Twenty-two years ago, I was born in Canada where I lived for 6 years until my family and I moved to the US. We spent two years in Auburn, Alabama until we decided to move to Michigan where we have been since. (Yes, I have dual citizenship.)

      <p>I'm fascinated by the world around me. I love music, computers, and the internet. I also love to travel. In my spare time I enjoy photography, reading, hacking on side projects (I just bought a Raspberry Pi!), and spending time with friends and family. I also have a soft spot for good food and HBO.</p>
      <p>I think writing is important, and I plan to do that here. Feel free to follow me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/angusnb">@angusnb</a> or shoot me an <a href="mailto:angusb@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
