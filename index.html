      <p class="greeting">Hey.</p>
      <p>I'm <a href="about/">Angus</a>. I figured it's about time I have my own page on the web, so this is my first attempt at doing so. I plan on setting up a blog in short order and powering it with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. Once that is done, I'll whip up some JavaScript to showcase some of my photography. What's coming:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Responsiveness (I am using Bootstrap after all)</li>
      <li>Write a blog</li>
      <li>Showcase some pictures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:angus@angusb.com">angus@angusb.com</a>.</p>
